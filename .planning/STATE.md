# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** Anyone can clone, configure, and run a self-hosted market intelligence pipeline with zero-config core sources and a health view that makes data freshness visible at a glance.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — health-visibility

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (health-visibility) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-collector-reliability P01 | 5min | 2 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 01 P02 | 7min | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 02-health-visibility P01 | 9min | 2 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 02-health-visibility P02 | 3min | 2 tasks | 6 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Codex Review]: Compressed 5→3 phases; original roadmap was too serialized for problem size
- [Codex Review]: Moved dead_letters, structlog, sparklines, pyproject.toml, check_setup.py, CI to v2
- [Codex Review]: Extend existing UI health primitives (ContextRail) instead of building standalone dashboard
- [Roadmap]: Start without pybreaker; add only if retry storms observed
- [Roadmap]: Single database with busy_timeout; split to health.db only if SQLITE_BUSY errors appear
- [Phase 01-collector-reliability]: FileNotFoundError check ordered before OSError (subclass relationship)
- [Phase 01-collector-reliability]: busy_timeout at 30s (6x RELY-03 requirement) -- documented, not changed
- [Phase 01]: Patched tenacity.nap.time.sleep in tests to avoid real waits
- [Phase 01]: Fallback error recording in scheduler for unexpected exceptions
- [Phase 02-health-visibility]: Disabled check takes priority over error status for sources missing env vars
- [Phase 02-health-visibility]: Volume anomaly requires min 3 days of data; SQLite naive datetimes treated as UTC
- [Phase 02-health-visibility]: Reused ContextRail status color palette for health source cards

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- 27 test collection errors need investigation (may surface during Phase 1)
- .env contains live Xueqiu cookies/tokens -- must not be committed
- 80MB production database needs migration testing before schema changes
